##  Performance Analysis

1. Sales by Segment
   Top-performing segment: The highest revenue came from a segment generating $53M, followed by segments at $42M and $20M.
   Underperforming segments: Two segments contributed marginally to revenue, with sales of $2M and $1M.

Insight: The focus should be on enhancing the performance of underperforming segments by identifying gaps and potential opportunities, such as improved marketing, product differentiation, or targeted discounts.

2. Units Sold by Product
The top two products each sold 0.17M units, with the next three products close behind at 0.16M, 0.16M, and 0.15M.
Insight: High unit sales indicate strong demand, but profitability per unit should be assessed to determine the products’ contributions to overall profitability.

3. Discounts by Product
The highest discounts were offered on Paseo (28.3%), followed by Velo (17.1%), and Montana (15.8%).

Insight: Significant discounts on top products might drive sales volume but could also impact profitability. A review of discount strategies is recommended to balance volume and margin.

4. Gross Sales by Segment
   
Gross sales are consistent with segment performance.
Highest segment: $56M.
Lowest segment: $21M.
Insight: Growth strategies should focus on low-performing segments while maintaining strong sales in leading segments.

5. Units Sold by Country
   
The map visualization shows varying contributions from different countries.
Insight: Regions with low sales could benefit from targeted campaigns to increase market penetration.

Top Product: Paseo contributed $5M (28.4% of total profit).
Other Products:
Velo: $3M (18%).
Amarilla: $3M (16.7%).

Insight: High profitability of Paseo underscores its importance. Less profitable products should be evaluated for cost optimization or repositioning strategies.

## Recommendations for Stakeholders

Product Portfolio Analysis:
